# Array Of Multiples Exercise

In this exercise you have to write code in the file `arrayOfMultiples.py` for calculating the array of multiples from a certain number.

You should write the code inside the block from the method, and delete **pass** keyword, where it says `Your amazing code here`.

Use python List data type as array for this excercise.

## Examples

get_arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

get_arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

get_arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

## Local Test

For testing your code you must run: 

```sh
pytest

```

## Notes:

- You can read the test files, so you can have an idea of what is the expected result, but **do not edit them** please.

- The result must be a *List*.

If you have any doubts, feel free to ask 😊
